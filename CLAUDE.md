# Instagram Caption Generator - Project Instructions

## Project Overview
Build a personal web application that uses AI to analyze uploaded images and generate Instagram-ready captions and hashtags. This is a single-user tool for personal use only.

## Core Functionality
- **Image Upload**: Drag & drop or click to upload images (JPG, PNG, GIF up to 10MB)
- **AI Analysis**: Use GPT-4 Vision API to analyze the uploaded image
- **Caption Generation**: Generate engaging, Instagram-style captions based on the image content
- **Hashtag Suggestions**: Provide relevant hashtags for better discoverability
- **Style Options**: Allow user to choose caption tone (Creative, Professional, Casual, Trendy, Inspirational)
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Easy copy functionality for both captions and hashtags

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- **Technology**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla or with minimal framework)
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **File Upload**: Support drag & drop and click upload
- **Image Preview**: Show uploaded image before processing
- **Loading States**: Display progress while AI processes the image
- **Error Handling**: Handle upload errors and API failures gracefully

### AI Integration
- **Recommended API**: OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API
- **Alternative**: Anthropic Claude API (if preferred)
- **API Key Security**: Store API key securely (environment variables for local development)
- **Cost Consideration**: Optimize requests to minimize API costs

### User Interface Design
- **Color Scheme**: Instagram-inspired gradient header (#405de6 to #fd1d1d)
- **Layout**: Two-column grid (upload section | results section)
- **Typography**: Modern, clean fonts (-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI')
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects, smooth transitions, visual feedback
- **Mobile First**: Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

## AI Prompt Strategy

### Image Analysis Prompt Template
```
Analyze this image for Instagram posting. Generate:

1. A [STYLE] caption that:
   - Captures the main subject/scene
   - Matches [STYLE] tone
   - Is 1-3 sentences
   - Includes relevant emojis
   - Encourages engagement

2. 10-15 hashtags that:
   - Mix popular (#photography) and niche tags
   - Are relevant to image content
   - Include location-based tags if applicable
   - Avoid banned or shadowbanned hashtags

Style: [Creative/Professional/Casual/Trendy/Inspirational]
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality (2-3 hours)
- Create HTML structure and basic CSS
- Implement file upload with preview
- Set up API integration
- Basic caption and hashtag generation
- Copy to clipboard functionality

### Phase 2: Enhanced UI/UX (1-2 hours)
- Add style selection buttons
- Implement loading states and animations
- Improve responsive design
- Add error handling and notifications

### Phase 3: Polish & Testing (1 hour)
- Fine-tune AI prompts for better results
- Test with various image types
- Optimize for mobile devices
- Add pro tips and user guidance

## Deployment Options
- **Local Development**: Run locally with API keys in environment variables
- **Simple Hosting**: Deploy to Netlify/Vercel with client-side API calls
- **Privacy-First**: Keep everything local, no data leaves your machine except API calls

## Security Considerations
- Never expose API keys in frontend code
- Use environment variables or secure server-side proxy
- No user data storage required
- API calls only contain image and style preference

## Cost Estimation
- **GPT-4 Vision API**: ~$0.01-0.03 per image analysis
- **Monthly cost**: Under $10 for typical personal use
- **Hosting**: Free tier options available (Netlify, Vercel)

## Success Metrics
- Image upload works smoothly
- AI generates relevant, engaging captions
- Hashtags are accurate and varied
- Copy functionality works reliably
- Mobile experience is seamless
- Total workflow time under 1 minute per image

## Future Enhancement Ideas
- Save favorite captions/hashtags
- A/B test different caption styles
- Integration with scheduling tools
- Bulk image processing
- Caption templates library
- Analytics on hashtag performance
