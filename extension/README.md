**Can't connect to app?**
- Verify your app is running: `npm start`

## Development

This extension uses:
- Manifest V2 (for Firefox compatibility)
- Content scripts for Instagram page interaction
- Background scripts for app communication
- Local storage for preferences

The extension communicates with your local Caption Generator app via REST API calls to localhost:3000.
